# February Code Jam - Paper Thoughts

Paper Thoughts is a React app that allows users to record thoughtfiul daily messages about the people in
their lives. This app features a Header with navigation bar to go between home, account, and settings. Users
have a collection of connections they have made, with each connection having its own calendar to display
dates that a thoughtful message was sent. User connections are displayed in an array of cards containing the
connection info which is housed within localStorage.

This app was built using React, CSS, and TypeScript
